   ```

2. **Business Rule Validation Issues**
   ```javascript
   // CheckoutButton.js - Currency display inconsistency
   "You must have at least ¬£0.30"  // Shows GBP instead of JPY
   ```

   - No e-commerce specific test cases
   - Missing payment flow testing
   - No cart functionality validation
   - Placeholder tests not updated for actual application

---

## üéØ CRITICAL TEST SCENARIOS MISSING

### 1. E-commerce Core Functionality
```gherkin
Feature: Shopping Cart Management
  Scenario: Add products to cart
    Given user is on product page
    When user adds products to cart
    Then cart should update quantity and total
    And cart persistence should work across sessions

Feature: Payment Processing
  Scenario: Successful Stripe checkout
    Given cart contains items worth ¬•30+
    When user proceeds to checkout
    Then Stripe payment flow should initiate
    And payment should process successfully
```

### 2. Business Rule Validation
- Minimum order validation (¬•30)
- Maximum cart items (20 items)
- Quantity boundaries (1-99 per item)
- Geographic restrictions (Japan only)
- Currency consistency (JPY)

### 3. Error Handling & Edge Cases
- Payment failures and retries
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid product data handling
- Cart state corruption scenarios

## üêõ DEFECT ANALYSIS

### High Severity Defects

1. **DEF-001: Data Corruption in Product Catalog (STILL CRITICAL)**
   - **Location:** `app/data/products.js`
   - **Issue:** Currency field typos ("YPY" instead of "JPY", missing 'c')
   - **Impact:** Payment processing failures, incorrect pricing display
   - **Priority:** P1 - Critical
   - **Live Status:** App works despite typos (Stripe uses price_id), but data integrity issue remains

2. **DEF-002: Currency Display Inconsistency (VERIFIED)**
   - **Location:** `app/components/CheckoutButton.js`
   - **Issue:** Error message shows GBP (¬£) instead of JPY (¬•)
   - **Impact:** User confusion, incorrect business rules
   - **Priority:** P1 - Critical
   - **Live Status:** Needs verification with minimum order testing

3. **DEF-003: Missing Test Implementation (CONFIRMED)**

   - **Issue:** Placeholder tests not updated for actual application
   - **Impact:** No quality assurance coverage
   - **Priority:** P1 - Critical
   - **Live Status:** Confirmed - tests do not match live application functionality

4. **DEF-004: Business Rule Validation Gaps (NEW - IDENTIFIED FROM LIVE)**
   - **Location:** Various components
   - **Issue:** Minimum order (¬•30) and maximum items (20) validation needs verification
   - **Impact:** Potential business rule bypass
